# Guess the Number Game

Welcome to the "Guess the Number" game, a fun and interactive web-based number guessing game built with Python and Flask. Test your luck and strategy by guessing a random number within a chosen difficulty range, with features like hints, scoring, and a modern interface!

## Overview

This game challenges players to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range (Easy: 1-50, Medium: 1-100, Hard: 1-200). It includes:
- Multiple difficulty levels
- A scoring system (lose points for guesses and hints)
- Hints to help you guess (at a point cost)
- A history of your guesses
- A responsive and visually appealing web interface

The game runs in a web browser and is built using Flask (Python), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the game, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.11 or higher** (check with `python --version`)
- **pip** (Python package manager, usually included with Python)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the game on your local machine:

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**  
   If you have Git installed, clone this repository:git clone <repository-url>
Otherwise, download the ZIP file and extract it to a folder named `number_guessing_game`.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**  
Open a terminal and move to the project directory:cd number_guessing_game


3. **Install Required Packages**  
Install Flask, the only dependency, using pip: pip install flask

If you encounter permission issues (e.g., on Windows), run the command as an administrator or use: pip install flask --user


4. **Verify Installation**  
Ensure Flask is installed correctly:python -c "import flask; print(flask.version)"

You should see a version number (e.g., `2.3.3`).

## Running the Game

1. **Start the Flask Server**  
From the `number_guessing_game` directory, run the following command:python app.py


2. **Access the Game**  
Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`. Youâ€™ll see the game interface where you can:
- Select a difficulty (Easy, Medium, or Hard)
- Click "Start" to begin a new game
- Enter your guesses in the number input
- Use hints (at a cost of 100 points)
- Track your attempts, score, and guess history

## How to Play

- **Choose a Difficulty**: Select Easy (1-50), Medium (1-100), or Hard (1-200) from the dropdown.
- **Start the Game**: Click "Start" to generate a random number.
- **Guess the Number**: Enter a number in the input field and click "Guess" to submit.
- **Get Feedback**: The game tells you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- **Use Hints**: Click "Hint (-100 points)" to get a clue, but it reduces your score.
- **Track Progress**: See your attempts, current score, and guess history on the screen.
- **Win**: Guess the number correctly to win and start a new game with your score reset to 1000.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `number_guessing_game/`
  - `static/`
    - `css/`
      - `style.css` # CSS for styling the game interface
    - `js/` # Optional JavaScript files (currently empty)
  - `templates/`
    - `game.html` # HTML template for the game UI
  - `app.py` # Main Flask application file
  - `README.md` # This file
## Customization

- **Change Difficulty Ranges**: Modify the ranges in `app.py` in the `new_game` function (e.g., change `ranges = {'easy': (1, 50), 'medium': (1, 100), 'hard': (1, 200)}`).
- **Adjust Scoring**: Update the scoring logic in `app.py` (e.g., change point deductions for guesses or hints).
- **Customize Styles**: Edit `static/css/style.css` to change colors, sizes, or layouts to match your preferences.

## Troubleshooting

- **Installation Errors**: If you encounter errors like `[WinError 2]` during `pip install flask`, see the "Installation" section for troubleshooting steps (e.g., run as administrator, check permissions).
- **Game Not Loading**: Ensure Flask is installed and `app.py` is running. Check the terminal for errors and verify the browser URL (`http://localhost:5000`).
- **Styling Issues**: If the interface looks different, ensure `game.html` links correctly to `style.css` using `{{ url_for('static', filename='css/style.css') }}`.
